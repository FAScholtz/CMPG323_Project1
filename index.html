        <p style="text-align: center;"><h4 style="margin-left: 25rem; margin-right: 25rem;">A 38 year old father of 
            three with a passion for IT. Employed for the past 19 years in the electricity
            industry, I find myself a student of North West University. I intend changing my career path from a 
            Distribution environment to a IT centered one with an intention to complete a Post Graduate Diploma in 
            Management. My career path is not necessarilly grounded within my current employer and neither is the 
            location static. I envisage myself within the Business Analytics environment.</p>
